# the-great-wall-china-guide
Created a travel guide website in HTML/CSS and implmented an API in JavaScript.

This project was created for my Web Systems module. I needed to create a specific tourist attraction, which was the Great China of Wall located in Beijing, China. 

Ensured that my website was data driven in some way, which involved using JavaScript to retrieve data from an API and display it on one of web pages.
